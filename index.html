            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="tabbed-p">
                I was born and raised in a small town on the Texas coast named Rockport. My five sisters and I grew up climbing trees and 
                rewatching the same VHS movies over and over, which is something I miss. Our household was musical, my father and grandfather
                being part time musicians, so at age eight I picked up the piano. While I regrettably quit after three years, I still on occasion
                sit down and play a piece. I hope to eventually relearn the instrument because it's one thing I enjoy very much.
            </p>
            <p class="tabbed-p">
                I always had an aptitude for computers, starting my
                programming escapades making simple <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roblox</a> 
                games and messing around in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. While I didn't
                have my own computer until I was 16, I used the family machine for all my "fun" projects (which thankfully have been lost to time).
                I loved programming, but I didn't have the guidance to progress my skills until my junior year of high school. I was lucky enough to have one teacher who
                taught and led me on the path to becoming a stand out computer scientist, placing 5th at the state-wide competition my senior year.
            </p>
            <p class="tabbed-p">
                Aside from programming, I have multiple other hobbies. Video games were something I loved as a teenager, and I still enjoy them on occasion, though more
                to socialize with my friends than for the games themselves. In an attempt to not stare at a screen for work, school, and entertainment, I spend a lot of my
                time doing other activities like reading books. Most recently, I've been reading 
                <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1954/hemingway/biographical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ernest Hemingway</a>
                who is an excellent author I highly recommend. I also enjoy walks in the park,
                listening to music (especially classical), and simply socializing with my friends in person.
            </p>
            <p class="tabbed-p">
                Post high school, I decided to attend Texas A&M University to get a degree in Computer Science and, consequently, a minor in Mathematics. I won't pretend I am the hardest working student, 
                but I absolutely love learning and believe you die the day you lose your willingness to learn. There are many options for post-college careers, so I hope
                to find something that will fulfill my need to constantly be learning.
            </p>
