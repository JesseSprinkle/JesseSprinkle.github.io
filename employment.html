                    <h3>Summer 2020</h3>
                    In this internship, IBM hired me to be a part of their 
                    <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-addons-iot-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon Components Addons React</a> team. 
                    This open source project is meant to provide webpage components and styles to IBM and other developers. 
                    From working on this project, I vastly expanded on my front end knowledge, learned of many valuable processes and tools, and improved my collaboration skills.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gained experience in <a href="https://reactjs.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sass</a>
                        by fixing various bugs and developing new component features</li>
                        <li>Learned about Github Actions and Git hooks which allow automatic linting, compilation, and error checking, vastly speeding up development</li>
                        <li>Worked in an Agile development environment where we held a daily scrum meeting, organized tasks, assigned them story points, 
                            and designated which tasks were to be completed each sprint. This sped up development, but also provided better team communication, organization, and cohesion. </li>

                        <h3 style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:13px">Summer 2018</h3>
						As my first professional software development experience I worked with Baytek International, a company providing database management solutions to gas and refining companies around the US.
						I was able to work with laboratory software and a full stack web application, providing valuable experience in diverse areas.
						<ul>
							<li>Learned Python and applied it to write an application that could remotely control devices on a local network. This involved using UDP to send custom command sequences
							to these devices; for example, messaging a vial sampling system to load/unload vials.</li>
							<li>Researched and implemented a method for calculating F-test critical values at any probability which required using Gaussian Quadrature to approximate a continuous function.
							This was then implemented as an option in the web application cBLISS using C#, JavaScript, and HTML.</li>
							<li>Used many software tools, such as Visual Studio and Git, to manage code and speed up development.</li>
						</ul>
                        <h3 style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:13px">Summer 2019</h3>
						As a returning intern, Baytek had me focus on maintaining their cBLISS LIMS (Laboratory Information Managment System) software, but also provided several projects that were later implemented in the product.
						<ul>
							<li>Wrote a C# graphing library to replace an outdated library. The new library used SVG images rather than PNG images, allowing them to be unpixellated and interactive.</li>
							<li>Developed and coded a method for determining which set of data a test sample belongs with.</li>
							<li>Fixed various software bugs and improved application stability.</li>
						</ul>
